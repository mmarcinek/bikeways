## Welcome to Bikeways

Bikeways is a crowd-sourced bike mapping application. The goal, when completed, is to create an intuitive and interactive
mapping solution for bicycle commuters, enthusiasts, weekend riders and even hard-core excersise trainers. The end goal is an application that can help all types of riders plan a safe way to get from point A to B and beyond by creating maps that aren't based on urban planners suggestions, but by real cyclists and how they ride in their city.

Bikeways has an angular project, it utilizes Ui-Router for nested views and Angular Material for design.

## Usage

This template contains some simple `gulp` tasks. They are as follows:


- `gulp watch`: This will launch a Node Server and start the standard `watchlist` task
- `gulp bower`: This will move the bower components into their proper location. This will run during the `watch` task, but you may need to run it manually once in a while

There are many more tasks, and you really should read through the `gulpfile.js`, but the ones above will take care of you in most cases.
